Name:  google_oauth2_client
Description:  Dart library to use for Google OAuth2 authentication / Client-side flow

Usage/Installation:

Go to https://code.google.com/apis/console/ and create a new Project
Create a new Client ID for web applications in "API Access"
Set JavaScript origins to your server or for example http://127.0.0.1:3030/ for local testing in Dartium

Add this dependency to your pubspec.yaml

  dependencies:
    google_oauth2_client:
      git: git://github.com/Scarygami/dart-google-oauth2-library.git

Import the library in your dart application:

  import "package:google_oauth2_client/oauth2.dart";

Initialize the library with your parameters:

final auth = new OAuth2(
  "YOUR CLIENT ID HERE",
  ["scope1", "scope2", ...],
  tokenLoaded:oauthReady);

The oauthReady function will be called once your app has a valid OAuth token to call the APIs.
If the user has authorized the app in the past, this will happen automatically.
Otherwise, you need to call auth.login() to trigger a confirmation dialog.

Once you have an access token you can use
  request.setRequestHeader("Authorization", "${auth.token.type} ${auth.token.data}");
to send authenticated requests to the API.

Alternatively you can use the OAuth client to set the headers in your request for you.
This will also refresh the access token if necessary:

auth.authenticate(request).then((request) => request.send(body));


See example/oauth_example.dart for example login and request.
