Name:  dart-google-oauth2-library
Description:  Dart library to use for Google OAuth2 authentication / Client-side flow

Usage/Installation:

Go to https://code.google.com/apis/console/ and create a new Project
Create a new Client ID for web applications in "API Access"
Set JavaScript origins to your server or for example http://127.0.0.1:3030/ for local testing in Dartium

Add this dependency to your pubspec.yaml

  dependencies:
    dart_google_oauth2_library:
      git: git://github.com/Scarygami/dart-google-oauth2-library.git

Import the library in your dart application:

  import "package:dart_google_oauth2_library/oauth2.dart";

Initialize the library with your parameters:

final auth = new OAuth2(
  "YOUR CLIENT ID HERE",
  ["scope1", "scope2", ...],
  tokenLoaded:oauthReady);

The oauthReady function will be called once your app has a valid OAuth token to call the APIs.
If the user has authorized the app in the past, this will happen automatically.
Otherwise, you need to call auth.login() to trigger a confirmation dialog.

Once you have an access token you can use
  request.setRequestHeader("Authorization", "${auth.token.type} ${auth.token.data}");
to send authenticated requests to the API.

See example/oauth_example.dart for example login and request.
