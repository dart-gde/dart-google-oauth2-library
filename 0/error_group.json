Each event is either a data event or\nan error event, representing the result of a single computation. When the\nStream is exhausted, it may send a single \"done\" event.\n\nYou can [listen] on a stream to receive the events it sends. When you listen,\nyou receive a [StreamSubscription] object that can be used to stop listening,\nor to temporarily pause events from the stream.\n\nWhen an event is fired, the listeners at that time are informed.\nIf a listener is added while an event is being fired, the change\nwill only take effect after the event is completely fired. If a listener\nis canceled, it immediately stops receiving events.\n\nWhen the \"done\" event is fired, subscribers are unsubscribed before\nreceiving the event. After the event has been sent, the stream has no\nsubscribers. Adding new subscribers after this point is allowed, but\nthey will just receive a new \"done\" event as soon as possible.\n\nStreams always respect \"pause\" requests. If necessary they need to buffer\ntheir input, but often, and preferably, they can simply request their input\nto pause too.\n\nThere are two kinds of streams: The normal \"single-subscription\" streams and\n\"broadcast\" streams.\n\nA single-subscription stream allows only a single listener at a time.\nIt holds back events until it gets a listener, and it may exhaust\nitself when the listener is unsubscribed, even if the stream wasn't done.\n\nSingle-subscription streams are generally used for streaming parts of\ncontiguous data like file I/O.\n\nA broadcast stream allows any number of listeners, and it fires\nits events when they are ready, whether there are listeners or not.\n\nBroadcast streams are used for independent events/observers.\n\nThe default implementation of [isBroadcast] returns false.\nA broadcast stream inheriting from [Stream] must override [isBroadcast]\nto return [:true:].\n","uri":"file:///usr/local/Cellar/dart-editor/25017/dart-sdk/lib/async/stream.dart","name":"Stream","id":"Stream","children":[{"returnType":{"refId":"dart.async/Stream","arguments":[{"refId":"dart.async/Stream/T","name":"T"}],"name":"Stream"},"comment":"\nReturns a multi-subscription stream that produces the same events as this.\n\nIf this stream is already a broadcast stream, it is returned unmodified.\n\nIf this stream is single-subscription, return a new stream that allows\nmultiple subscribers.

It is used to obtain a not-yet\navailable value, or error, sometime in the future.  Receivers of a\n[Future] can register callbacks that handle the value or error once it is\navailable. For example:\n\n    Future<int> future = getFuture();\n    future.then((value) => handleValue(value))\n          .catchError((error) => handleError(error));\n\nA [Future] can be completed in two ways: with a value (\"the future succeeds\")\nor with an error (\"the future fails\"). Users can install callbacks for each\ncase. The result of registering a pair of callbacks is a new Future (the\n\"successor\") which in turn is completed with the result of invoking the\ncorresponding callback. The successor is completed with an error if the\ninvoked callback throws. For example:\n\n    Future<int> successor = future.then((int value) {\n        // Invoked when the future is completed with a value.\n        return 42;  // The successor is completed with the value 42.\n      },\n      onError: (e) {\n        // Invoked when the future is completed with an error.\n        if (canHandle(e)) {\n          return 499;  // The successor is completed with the value 499.\n        } else {\n          throw e;  // The successor is completed with the error e.\n        }\n      });\n\nIf a future does not have a successor but is completed with an error, it\nforwards the error message to the global error-handler. This special casing\nmakes sure that no error is silently dropped. However, it also means that\nerror handlers should be installed early, so that they are present as soon\nas a future is completed with an error. The following example demonstrates\nthis potential bug:\n\n    var future = getFuture();\n    new Timer(new Duration(milliseconds: 5), () {\n      // The error-handler is only attached 5ms after the future has been\n      // received. If the future fails in the mean-time it will forward the\n      // error to the global error-handler, even though there is code (just\n      // below) to handle the error.\n      future.then((value) { useValue(value); },\n                  onError: (e) { handleError(e); });\n    });\n\nIn general we discourage registering the two callbacks at the same time, but\nprefer to use [then] with one argument (the value handler), and to use\n[catchError] for handling errors. The missing callbacks (the error-handler\nfor [then], and the value-handler for [catchError]), are automatically\nconfigured to \"forward\" the value/error. Separating value and error-handling\ninto separate registration calls usually leads to code that is easier to\nreason about. In fact it makes asynchronous code very similar to synchronous\ncode:\n\n    // Synchronous code.\n    try {\n      int value = foo();\n      return bar(value);\n    } catch (e) {\n      return 499;\n    }\n\n Equivalent asynchronous code, based on futures:\n\n    Future<int> future = foo();  // foo now returns a future.\n    future.then((int value) => bar(value))\n          .catchError((e) => 499);\n\nSimilar to the synchronous code, the error handler (registered with\n[catchError]) is handling the errors for exceptions coming from calls to\n'foo', as well as 'bar'. This would not be the case if the error-handler was\nregistered at the same time as the value-handler.\n\nFutures can have more than one callback-pairs registered. Each successor is\ntreated independently and is handled as if it was the only successor.\n","uri":"file:///usr/local/Cellar/dart-editor/25017/dart-sdk/lib/async/future.dart","name":"Future","id":"Future","children":[{"returnType":{"refId":"dart.async/Future","arguments":[{"refId":"dart.core/List","name":"List"}],"name":"Future"},"isStatic":true,"comment":"\nWait for all the given futures to complete and collect their values.\n\nReturns a future which will complete once all the futures in a list are\ncomplete.
